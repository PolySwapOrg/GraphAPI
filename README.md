## Project Description

ParaSwap is nice aggregator that gives best routes of exchange but everytime I wanna see the Best routes any pair then I have to manually select, So i built this Dapp which gives users to glance to decide the best routes for Top token Pairs on Ethereum, BSC and Polygon 

For this project i have used, The Graph API to fetch Top pairs and paraSwap api to get the best route!
